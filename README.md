# My Cafe Memories

This is a social network site for users to share memories of their cafes.

A non-user can browse this website to see everyone's cafe memories.

If they become an user, they will be able to add their cafe memories.
They can add their memories from "Add memory" page. 

They can search the cafe names by auto complete. 

They can add cafe name(auto-complete), description, photo link, rating(1 to 5), Date(datepicker).

If they are unable to find the cafe, they can add a cafe from "Add cafe" page.

On "Add cafe" page, they can add area name(auto-complete), cafe name, website, postal address, postcode, photo link, and youtube link(optional).

They can also browse and edit/ delete cafes from "Manage cafes" page.

## UX

This page starts with a Google map with location markers. An user can click on each marker to see the details on a popup modal. They can see either photo or an Youtube video, also a short description.

After adding 2 or more locations, then they can check distance by clicking on "Check Distance" button.

The steps:
 
<ol>
<li>A Google Map with markers on destinations are shown.</li>
<li>An user can choose a category by clicking on a category button to filter markers</li>
<li>When an user clicks on a marker, a popup is shown to display the information of the destination</li>
<li>The dialog has two buttons - "Add to your tour" and "Close"</li>
<li>When an user clicks on "Add to your tour", it will add the destination to the tour plan and display the name of the destination in "Your Tour" box.</li>
<li>When an user clicks on "Close" button, it closes the dialog</li>
<li>In "Your Tour", an user can click the "delete" button to delete the destination from the tour</li>
<li>In "Your Tour", an user can click the "Move up" button to replace the order of the place with the one before.</li>
<li>In "Your Tour", an user can click the "Move up" button to replace the order of the place with the one next.</li>
<li>When an user clicks on the "Check Distance" button, it will display the tour map on the map, also calculates total KM, total duration, and calories consumed.</li>
</ol>


## Features

The Marker has my original animation, so an end user can easily identify the icon for each category.

This is using a json file for the data, so we can easily add more data or import data from another website etc.

We can add more data using the json file
 
### Existing Features

Marker Buttons - enable an user to see the destination details with a video or a photo.

"Check Distance" button - enables an user to see the distance and also calories they will consume by this tour, so they can plan their walking tour accurately.


### Features Left to Implement
- I would like to add more categories
- I would like to add more destinations, and pages for different towns
- I wouuld like to make icon ticked, and display the order on the marker when added to the tour
